###   http-library               Which library to use for http/https
###                              connections.
###   http-bulk-updates          Whether to request bulk update
###                              responses or to fetch each file
###                              in an individual request.
###   store-passwords            Specifies whether passwords used
###                              to authenticate against a
###                              Subversion server may be cached
###                              to disk in any way.
###   store-ssl-client-cert-pp   Specifies whether passphrase used
###                              to authenticate against a client
###                              certificate may be cached to disk
###                              in any way
###   store-auth-creds           Specifies whether any auth info
###                              (passwords, server certs, etc.)
###                              may be cached to disk.
###   username                   Specifies the default username.
###
### Set store-passwords to 'no' to avoid storing new passwords on
### disk in any way, including in password stores.  It defaults to
### 'yes', but Subversion will never save your password to disk in
### plaintext unless explicitly configured to do so.
###
### Set store-ssl-client-cert-pp to 'no' to avoid storing new ssl
### client certificate passphrases in the auth/ area of your
### config directory.  It defaults to 'yes', but Subversion will
### never save your passphrase to disk in plaintext unless
### explicitly configured to do so.
###
### Set store-auth-creds to 'no' to avoid storing any new Subversion
### credentials in the auth/ area of your config directory.
### Note that this includes SSL server certificates.
### It defaults to 'yes'.
###
### Note that setting a 'store-*' option to 'no' only prevents
### saving of *new* passwords, passphrases or other credentials.
### It does not remove or invalidate existing stored credentials.
### To do that, see the 'svn auth --remove' command, or remove the
### cache files by hand as described in the Subversion book at
### http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.tour.initial.authn-cache-purge
###
### HTTP timeouts, if given, are specified in seconds.  A timeout
### of 0, i.e. zero, causes a builtin default to be used.
###
### Most users will not need to explicitly set the http-library
### option, but valid values for the option include:
###    'serf': Serf-based module (Subversion 1.5 - present)
### Availability of these modules may depend on your specific
### Subversion distribution.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended only to
### demonstrate how to use this file; any resemblance to actual
### servers, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.
